Fork SushiSwapâ€™s SushiBar contract and implement following featuresStaking:

> 2 days - 0% can be unstaked - 172800 seconds
> 2-4 days - 25% can be unstaked - 345600 sec
> 4-6 days - 50% can be unstaked - 518400 sec
> 6-8 days - 75% can be unstaked - 691200 sec
> After 8 days - 100% can be unstaked.This will work like a high tax though.
> 0-2 days - locked
> 2-4 days - 75% tax
> 4-6 days - 50% tax
> 6-8 days - 25% tax
> After 8 days, 0% tax.
> The tokens received on tax will go back into rewards pool.
